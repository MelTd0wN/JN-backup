<KEY<MSGThere's a book here about
Missile Launchers.<NOD
Read it?<YNJ0000<CLR<TURThe standard missile launcher is
capable of holding a large amount
of ammunition.<NOD<CLRThe standard missile launcher is
also capable of holding its full
power under a lot of stress.<NOD<CLRAs such, the standard launcher is
best used in situations involving
several smaller enemies.<NOD<CLRIf, however, one were to
sacrifice both these features,<NOD<CLRA "Super Missile" would be
capable of taking out much larger
foes in a shorter period of time.<NOD<END

At the cost of some ammunition,
